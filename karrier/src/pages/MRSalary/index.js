									The sales job is one of the toughest jobs. Generally in any sales job, you have to make new
									clients month after month in order to achieve your targets as your clients don’t give you
									sales every month. But in the pharmaceutical industry, once you convert a doctor for your
									brand, he keeps writing your product every month, so there is continuous business generation
									month after month. If you’re able to convert 10-15 doctors from your territory then you are
									able to achieve your target. For fresher medical representative jobs are better than any
									other sales jobs.
									<br />
									That doesn’t mean that pharma selling is an easy job, conversion of a doctor is not an easy
									task. The doctor is one of society's most respected & knowledgeable people, so for their
									conversion, the rep should possess a good personality, communication skills & scientific
									knowledge. Doctors like the person having sound knowledge about therapy & product, so the
									person having such abilities have more probability to convert them. If you’re a hard worker
									& want to learn & grow then this industry suits you well. The Pharma industry is a
									science/knowledge-driven industry, so if anyone seeking good career growth in pharma selling
									then he must acquire these skills in order to overcome cutthroat competition.
